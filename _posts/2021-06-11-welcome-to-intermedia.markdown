Hi there!

For a long time Intermedia was very well known as a trusted cloud communications provider. We are helping over 122,000 businesses connect better from wherever, whenever. Our teams are working on voice, video conferencing, chat and a lot of other communication and collaboration services that help our customers grow their businesses. We are actively spreading the word about our new services and features through [twitter][intermedia-twitter], [facebook][intermedia-facebook], [linkedin][intermedia-linkedin] and other social media platforms.

But what about engineering side of our work? Up until this time this was mostly covered in mystery. For years we were learning by our own trials and errors and by absorbing valuable insights from engineering community.

Now we want to start giving back! Our talented engineers from various teams are eager to share their experience with the world!

We strongly belive that our stories will help engineers around the world to learn something new, resolve some complicated problem or just have some interesting reading during breaks from coding:)

**This is our first post in a brand-new Engineering Blog!**

Here you will find useful and interesting insights on mobile and fullstack development, thoughts on DEV and QA processes, our open source contributions and even some biting and humorous stories from our engineering experience!

So let's wait no more and dive right into our first topics: 

- [Dealing with iOS 14 local network permission]({% post_url 2021-06-11-ios14-local-network %})
- [Resolving WebRTC compatibility issues between multiple dependencies]({% post_url 2021-06-11-webrtc-buildscript %})

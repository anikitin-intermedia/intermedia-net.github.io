Hi there!

For quite a long time Intermedia is being known as a trusted cloud communications provider that helps over 122,000 businesses connect better – through voice, video conferencing, chat, file sharing and backup, security, archiving, and more – from wherever, whenever. That's quite a lot and we are actively spreading the word about our new services and features through [twitter][intermedia-twitter], [facebook][intermedia-facebook], [linkedin][intermedia-linkedin] and other social media platforms.

But what about engineering side of our work? Up until this time this was mostly covered in mystery. For years we were collecting knowledge by learning on our own mistakes and discoveries and by absorbing valuable insights from the engineering community.

Now we want to start giving back! Our talented engineers from various teams are eager to share their experience with the world: how we've overcome a tricky issue or made a great open-source tool even greater, how we've built and enhanced our development processes and what we've learned from working on various huge and impactful projects.

We strongly belive that our stories will help engineers around the world to learn something new or probably resolve some complicated problem, like they've helped us by sharing their experience.

**This is our first post in a brand-new Engineering Blog!**

Here you will find useful and interesting insights on mobile and fullstack development, thoughts on DEV and QA processes, our open soure contributions and even some biting and humorous stories from our engineering experience!

So let's wait no more and dive right into what we've prepared as our first topics: 

- [Dealing with iOS 14 local network permission]({% post_url 2021-06-11-ios14-local-network %})
- [Resolving WebRTC compatibility issues between multiple dependencies]({% post_url 2021-06-11-webrtc-buildscript %})

`And one more thing: we are actively hiring, so if you'll become interested in what we are doing please be sure to check our` [open positions][intermedia-careers]
